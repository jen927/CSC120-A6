- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
It was a bit confusing at first, but after sketching the tree of different classes, it makes sense. It's really helpful because it saves time and makes our code more sufficent.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I finally used exceptions, but I'm not super confident in my usage of them. When I was unsure what a part of my program wasn't working, I added print statements in each execuation so I can trace where the mistake occured. That was really helpful, especially in the library class. Also, just taking your time to read over anything new and understand how it works. I spent some time looking over some articles of Hashtable just to visually see how it's structured. That really helped use it in my code. Overall, I would say take breaks between coding sessions because sometimes an idea will pop into your head after having time to process what you are seeing.
